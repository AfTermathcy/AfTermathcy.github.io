Hi, welcome to my website! I am a final year Ph.D. student in the Department of [Industrail Engineering and Operations Research Department](https://ieor.columbia.edu/) at Columbia University, where I am fortunate to be advised by Professor [Yuri Faenza](https://www.columbia.edu/~yf2414/) and Professor [Jay Sethuraman](https://www.columbia.edu/~js1353/). 

My research focuses on matching markets and mechanism design, studied from both theoretical and applied perspectives. In particular, I have worked on problems related to:
- Stable matchings.
- School choice.
- Kidney exchange markets.
- Strategic behaviors and strategyproofness.

More broadly, I am also interested in discrete optimization, algorithmic game theory, algorithmic complexity and online resource allocation.
# Before joining Columbia IEOR, I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Mathematics from Zhejiang University.
